Zenith is a performance optimization mod focused on generalized improvements to many features throughout the game.

Leveraging parallelism, SIMD instructions, GPU rendering, and other optimizations, Zenith is able to provide a significant boost in performance.

General Feature Overview
 * Rewrites and optimizes dust rendering to be done almost entirely on the GPU
 * Parallelizes dust updating
 * Replaces usages of typical FNA types with JIT intrinsic SIMD types in notable hotspots
