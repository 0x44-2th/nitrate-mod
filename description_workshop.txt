Nitrate is a performance optimization mod focused on generalized improvements to many features throughout the game.

Leveraging parallelism, SIMD instructions, GPU rendering, and other optimizations, Nitrate is able to provide a significant boost in performance.

[h2]General Feature Overview[/h2]

[list]
    [*] Rewrites and optimizes dust rendering to be done almost entirely on the GPU (~5x faster in testing, mileage may vary)
    [*] Parallelizes dust updating (~5x faster in testing, mileage may vary)
    [*] Replaces usages of typical FNA types with JIT intrinsic SIMD types in notable hotspots
