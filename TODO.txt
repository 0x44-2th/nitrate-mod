- Dust particle renderer should support modded dusts.
  - This will take a lot of effort and will never be perfect. Performance will take a massive hit if we try to value accuracy to extremely.
  - This is at least partially reliant on runtime atlasing which we have not implemented.
- Rain particle renderer should support modded water styles.
  - This should be generally easier than dust but is a lower priority.
- Find more methods to target with general optimizations:
  1. employment of `FasterParallel.For`,
  2. application of "SIMDification".
- Benchmark "SIMDification".
  - How far can we take the optimizations? Try to eventually write a design sophisticated enough to prefer SIMD types in variable declarations and other uses with only small wrappers being created to pass SIMD types to their XNA equivalents.
- Maybe replace lighting `FastParallel.For` calls with `FasterParallel.For`, or IL edit `FastParallel.For` to use the same optimizations we use.
- Clean up checks regarding tile nullability automatically? They're always false.
